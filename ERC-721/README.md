# ERC-721

- Introduced in 2017, ERC-721 is a revolutionary token standard that set off the NFT phenomenon and became an NFT creation pillar in Ethereum’s ecosystem. The ERC-721 token standard has been a cornerstone for billions of dollars worth of NFTs. The token standard provides a standard interface for NFTs, and all tokens are unique. ERC-721 allows NFTs to be transferred between accounts, also making them tradeable for other currencies.

- One of ERC-721’s practical functions is that it allows users to identify the total supply of a set of NFTs available on the network. Other functionalities include obtaining the current token balance of an account and approval of the number of tokens within an account that a third-party account can transfer.

- NFTs based on ERC-721 are most commonly used for digital artwork, but use cases also extend to music and blockchain-based games.
